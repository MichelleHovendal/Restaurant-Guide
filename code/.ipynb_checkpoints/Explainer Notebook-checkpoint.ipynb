    "# Final Explainer Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is done as part of the final project for 02806 Social Data Analysis and Visualization, Technical University of Denmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains all the code used for the website: https://restaurant-guide.github.io/\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that this notebook is only rendered with data from 2019-2021, so not the full dataset. This is done, because of GitHub storage limitations. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Motivation\n",
    "### 1.1 Purpose \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the final project for Social Data Analysis and Visualization is to investigate restaurants and their reviews through a dataset from Yelp. The company Yelp will be described in the next subsection. Nowadays before going to a restaurant, you look it up on Google. Here it is possible to check the ratings of a restaurant and the comments. Hence, fake reviews are a hot topic, where business owners can promote their business falsely. The idea of this project is to find the best restaurant based on chosen types of restaurant, kitchen, price, review score without fake reviews in the dataset. From this, the user is able to find the perfect restaurant through an interactive application, but also see how the fake reviews are detected.\n",

    "<!-- The aim of the project is to find the best restaurant based on chosen type of restaurant, kitchen, price, review score without fake reviews.  -->\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Data\n",
    "The dataset considered for this project is from Yelp, which is an American company founded in 2004. The idea behind the company is to publish crow-sourced reviews about businesses through their website Yelp.com and mobile app Yelp. In the second quarter of 2019, Yelp has an average of 61.8 million unique visitors through their website, while it was 76.7 million unique visitors in the app. As the internet gets filled with more and more information and the likelihood of the information being false, Yelp can then provides a local platform for people to discover true information. So the dataset from Yelp considers different businesses and not only restaurants, which is the focus of this project. If a restaurant is not part of Yelp, they are not considered in this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the Yelp dataset is a subset of Yelp's businesses, reviews and users, which covers 11 metropolitan areas. All the dataset consists of the following information:\n",
    "* 8,635,403 reviews\n",
    "* 160,585 business\n",
    "* 200,000 pictures\n",
    "* 2,189,457 unique users\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset stretches over a period from 14th of October 2004 to 28th of January 2021. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, three of Yelps dataset is used. The main dataset consists of all the different businesses and some attributes explaining opening hours, price range and category. Furthermore, a dataset consisting of all the reviews and when the reviews are given is also used. To detect anomalies in the data, the dataset about the user that has given a review is also used. So to sum up, the following data files were used throughout this project\n",
    "* yelp_academic_dataset_business.json (121.466 KB)\n",
    "* yelp_academic_dataset_review.json (6.774.100 KB)\n",
    "* yelp_academic_dataset_user.json (3.598.150 KB)\n",
    "\n",
    "See reference [1] for the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Basic stats. Let's understand the dataset better\n",
    "\n",
    "Before doing data analysis on the dataset, it is key to do some basic statistics on the chosen dataset. Before doing basic statistics, some data cleaning and preprocessing are done.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Data cleaning & preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the section about the dataset, there are multiple businesses considered in our dataset. The businesses that do not have the word *Restaurant* in the column `categories` will not be considered. Further, restaurants that are closed have been removed, because it does not make sense to give advice for the user to go to a closed restaurant. \n",
    "To get some useful information from the `categories` column, two new variables are created. The first variable explains the kitchen type of the restaurant, whereas the second variable explains the type of restaurant, i.e. if it is a pizzeria. The list of words for the two variables are presented below\n",
    "\n",
    "* Kitchen type: Thai, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Indian, American, Caribean, Italian, Mediterranean, Mexican, Cajun, Vietnamese and Greek.\n",
    "* Type: Food, nightlife, bars, sandwiches, pizza, breakfast & brunch, fast food, burgers, salad, buffet, cafes, coffee & tea, vegetarian, steakhouse, sushi bars, diners and wine bars. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data from Yelp also give what state the different restaurants are in but in abbrivations. Hence the full state name and to do some plotting later on where the states are, the states latitude and longitude are also inserted. \n",
    "\n",
    "From merging the three datasets, the shape is `(6.588.460, 27)`, to make with more compatible a shorter time period is considered, namely 1st of January 2014 to 28th of January 2021, which gives a shape of `(5.177.322, 27)`. Remeber that these numbers cannot be compared with the shapes below, since this notebook only covers around two years.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see the dataprep alone, please see the python file: `Social Data - Data Prep - Final`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Libaries\n",
    "The libraries used for this project are presented below."

    "\n",
    "The overall basic statistics are described in the previous section, however, when doing analysis it is key to narrow it in to focus on fewer things. Hence a focus area is chosen to present some nice plots for the user of the website. Primarily bar charts are used since they give a nice overview of how the data is distributed between different areas. \n",
    "Mainly this section is split into four subsections. The first section will give you a brief introduction to where the states, how many restaurants, but also present how many there are under the two self-made categories, namely kitchen and type. The next section will give an overview of how the stars are distributed on state, kitchen and type. Furthermore, a subsection presentation of the price range of the restaurants is also displayed like the score subsection. The last section will dig deeper into the time-based metric. Here it will be presented what time of the day most reviews are done based on the three categories, state, kitchen and type. There will also be presented a map of Austin, TX for the year 2020, where it is possible to see the development of reviews per week throughout the year.\n",

    "This section will build your fundamental understanding of the dataset considered throughout this website. The figure below illustrates a world map of North America, where the light blue illustrates which states the data is covering. You can hover over the light blue circle to see how many restaurants there are in each state. The state where there is the most restaurant in Massachusetts and the states where are the fewest in Kansas and Kentucky. From this map, it is also possible to see that the dataset only covers one state in Canada, British Columbia.\n",

This is done to give an overview of when restaurants are reviewed the most during different time periods and for different restaurant categories. In the chart below you can see the total number of reviews made each hour for each weekday. Clearly, all weekdays follow the same pattern of a very low number of reviews in the morning and then a steady increase in reviews until 6-7 pm. After the evening-peak there is a small decrease in reviews for a few hours, whereafter the number of reviews increases again until 0-1 am. This night peak is of course due to the Yelp data also containing bars and nightlife locations and also, people might not review their visits until later when they get home from a restaurant visit. You can click on the days to the right of the chart to include/exclude them from the visualization."

Other than this, you can see in the chart that there are most reviews during the summer with a peak in July or August and less reviews during the winter.

The close-ups are used on the map of where the restaurants are placed in North America and the user is able to zoom. On the other plots, feature distinction is used by the different colors. This is done, so the user can see a difference between for example stars by state.

    "*Think critically about your creation? What went well? What is still missing? What could be improved? Why?*\n",
    "\n",
    "When thinking about the creation of this analysis of the restaurant dataset from Yelp, a better way to have solved this problem could be to only focus on one state and then do a more in-depth analysis of each restaurant and why they are popular in a specific time of the day and so on. This could also have led to an easier way to detect the fake reviews and see if there is a pattern in the reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the project went well, because the user can understand the dataset without any knowledge of Yelp and get a feeling of where the different restaurants are located, how many reviews there are in each of the three categories that are analysed and inspect when the reviews are given.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this project, different bar charts are presented to the user and where the main score has been a count of the different restaurants, stars, price range, etc. Here other metrics could have been used. Because it was seen that the number of restaurants is varying a lot, some states have above 2000 restaurants and some have 1 restaurant. If the user is not aware of it, it can lead to wrong conclusions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this project is to build an interactive plot, where fake reviews are deleted removed. From this interactive plot, the user can pick and select as he/she wants to. Furthermore, some more features could have been added to the plot, i.e. opening hours, parking, median income. Another interactive plot that could have been made is a search plot, where the user could write the name of a restaurant and all the information of the restaurant will pop up and give useful information about the restaurant. \n",
    "Furthermore, it could also have been interesting the look at the median income for the different states/cities, to analyse if there is a pattern between restaurants scores, price range and income level. If one wants to check out income data for North America, then check our reference [8].\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up, all these reflections can and should be taken into account when working with telling a story from data."
