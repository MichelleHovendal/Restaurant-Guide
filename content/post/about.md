## What is Yelp?

Yelp is an American company founded in 2004. The idea behind the company is to publish 
crowd-sourced reviews about businesses through their website Yelp.com and mobile app Yelp.
In the second quarter of 2019, Yelp has an average of 61.8 million unique visitors through
their website, while it was 76.7 million unique visitors on the app. As the internet gets 
filled with more and more information and the likelihood of the information being false, 
Yelp then provides a local platform for people to discover the true information.
